   - Set the redirect URL to: `http://localhost:8000/auth/zoho/callback` (adjust host if different)
   - Add the credentials to your `.env` (see Configuration section)

11. **Start services**
    - Development script (recommended):
      ```bash
      composer run dev
      ```

      - Start in: `C:\xampp\htdocs\outlook-web`
    - Or use a background PowerShell job or a cron on Linux.

## Development

### Running the application

For development, you can use the built-in development script that runs multiple services concurrently:

```bash
composer run dev
```

This will start:
- Laravel development server (http://localhost:8000)
- Queue worker for background jobs
- Log viewer (Pail) for real-time log monitoring
- Vite development server for hot module replacement

The development script uses `concurrently` to run all services with color-coded output and automatic cleanup on exit.

### Manual development setup

Alternatively, you can run services individually:

```bash
# Start Laravel server
php artisan serve

# Start queue worker (in another terminal)
php artisan queue:listen

# Start Vite dev server (in another terminal)
npm run dev
```

Note: If you're running under XAMPP/Apache, point your virtual host/document root to the `public` directory of this project.

## Notes

- The application is designed to work with XAMPP on Windows [[memory:7264487]]
- Python scripts are used for email operations to leverage existing email libraries
- OAuth integration for Zoho is implemented using Laravel Socialite
- The application uses Laravel's built-in authentication and session management
- Email accounts support both OAuth tokens and password authentication
- **AWS S3 Cloud Storage**: All synced emails are automatically saved to AWS S3 as EML files for cloud access
- Network diagnostics are available for troubleshooting email connectivity issues
- All Python scripts use only standard library modules (no external dependencies required)
- The application includes comprehensive error handling and logging for email operations
- Email files are stored in RFC 2822 format for maximum compatibility with email clients

## Troubleshooting

- "Database file does not exist" with SQLite: ensure `database/database.sqlite` exists and `.env` `DB_DATABASE` points to its absolute path on Windows, e.g. `C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\outlook-web\\database\\database.sqlite`.
- 404 on assets/images: run `php artisan storage:link` and ensure you built assets with `npm run dev` (dev) or `npm run build` (prod).
- Email sync/send issues: check `storage/logs/laravel.log`. Use `python test_network.py imap.zoho.com 993` to validate connectivity.
- OAuth redirect mismatch: verify `APP_URL` and `ZOHO_REDIRECT_URI` match your configured callback in the provider.

## Security

- Keep OAuth secrets in `.env` and never commit them.
- Rotate tokens and passwords regularly; prefer OAuth over password auth when possible.
- Limit access via Laravel policies; ensure accounts are only visible to their owners.

## Backup & Data

- Back up `database/` (SQLite) or your external DB and `storage/` for attachments and local emails.
- **AWS S3 Storage**: All emails and attachments are stored in AWS S3 with built-in backup and versioning.
- **Local Attachments**: Temporary attachments stored in `storage/app/attachments/` and `storage/app/email-attachments/`.
- Logs are in `storage/logs/`; prune or rotate as needed for disk space.

## FAQ

- "Nothing appears after login" â†’ Ensure migrations ran and queues/Vite are running in dev.
- "Attachments not accessible" â†’ Run `php artisan storage:link` and verify file permissions.
- "SMTP auth failed" â†’ Confirm provider settings, app passwords, or OAuth tokens are valid and not expired.
- "Want to start fresh with email data" â†’ Use `php artisan emails:refresh --force` to clear all email data and start over.
- "Local folders not created" â†’ Use `php artisan emails:test-folders` to verify folder functionality.
